This website is designed to provide information about common Modems/Routers found within New Zealand **(NZ)** and how these can be configured for NZ Internet Service Providers **(ISP)**.

The aim is to become a one stop source for modem/router information in order to assist regular users in using their own devices where possible.

An additional goal would be to support these ISPs in better supporting their customers by making this information freely available and easy to understand.
